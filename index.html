    <h1><u>Radiohead</u></h1>

    <h2><em>First years</em></h2>
    <p>The members of <b>Radiohead</b> met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in
        Abingdon,<br>
        Oxfordshire. Guitarist and singer <em>Thom Yorke</em> and bassist <em>Colin Greenwood</em> were in the same
        year, guitarist<br>
        <em>O'Brien</em> and drummer <em>Philip Selway</em> the year above, and multi-instrumentalist <em>Jonny
            Greenwood</em>, brother of
        <em>Ed Colin</em>,<br>
        two years below. In 1985, they formed <b>On a Friday</b>, the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in
        the<br>
        school's music room. Jonny was the last to join, first on harmonica and then keyboards, but soon became
        lead<br>
        guitarist; he had previously been in another band, Illiterate Hands, with musician Nigel Powell and
        Yorke's<br>
        brother Andy Yorke. According to Colin, the band members picked their instruments because they wanted to
        play<br>
        together, rather than through any particular interest: "It was more of a collective angle, and if you
        could<br>
        contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool." At one point, On a
        Friday<br>
        featured a saxophone section.

    <h2><em>Early succes</em></h2>
    <p>Radiohead recorded their debut release, the Drill EP, with Hufford and Edge at <em>Courtyard Studios</em>.
        Released in May<br>
        1992, its chart performance was poor. The band enlisted <em>Paul Kolderie</em> and <em>Sean Slade</em>, who
        had
        worked with US<br>
        indie bands <b>Pixies</b> and <b>Dinosaur Jr.</b>, to produce their debut album, recorded quickly in an
        Oxford
        studio in<br>
        1992.[2] With the release of the "Creep" single later that year, Radiohead began to receive attention in
        the<br>
        British music press, not all of it favourable; NME described them as "a lily-livered excuse for a rock<br>
        band",[15] and "Creep" was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1 because it was deemed "too depressing".[16]
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2><em>Critical recognition and grownig fanbase</em></h2>
    <p>Radiohead began work on their second album in 1994 with veteran <em>Abbey Road Studios</em> producer John
        Leckie.
        Tensions<br>
        were high, with mounting expectations to match the success of "Creep". Recording felt unnatural in
        the,br<br>
        studio, with the band having over-rehearsed the material. Seeking a change of scenery, they toured the
        Far<br>
        East, Australasia and Mexico and found greater confidence performing their new music live. However,
        troubled<br>
        by his new fame, Yorke became disillusioned with being "at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy,
        <strong>MTV</strong> eye-candy<br>
        lifestyle" he felt he was helping to sell to the world. The My Iron Lung EP and single, released in
        1994,<br>
        was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second<br>
        album. It was their first time working with their future producer Nigel Godrich, then working under
        Leckie<br>
        as an audio engineer. It was also Radiohead's first collaboration with artist Stanley Donwood, who has<br>
        produced all of their artwork since. Promoted through alternative radio stations, My Iron Lung's sales
        were<br>
        better than expected, and suggested that the band had found a loyal fanbase and were not one-hit
        wonders.<br>

    <h2><em>OK Computer and critical acclaim</em></h2>
    <p>By late 1995, <strong>Radiohead</strong> had already recorded one song that would appear on their next
        record.
        "Lucky", released<br>
        as a single to promote the War Child charity's The Help Album, was recorded in a brief session with <br>
        <em>Nigel Godrich</em>, the young audio engineer who had assisted on <em>The Bends</em> and produced a 1996
        B-side, "Talk Show Host".<br>
        Radiohead decided to self-produce their next album with Godrich, and began work in early 1996. By July they
        had<br>
        recorded four songs at their rehearsal studio, Canned Applause, a converted apple shed in the countryside
        near<br>
        Didcot, Oxfordshire. In August 1996, Radiohead toured as the opening act for <b>Alanis Morissette</b>. They
        resumed<br>
        recording not at a studio but at St. Catherine's Court, a 15th-century mansion near Bath. The sessions
        were<br>
        relaxed, with the band playing at all hours of the day, recording in different rooms, and listening to
        the<br>
        Beatles, DJ Shadow, Ennio Morricone and Miles Davis for inspiration.</p>
